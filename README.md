### Easy installation (Not available as of this moment, [see why](https://github.com/sycanz04/schedulr?tab=readme-ov-file#project-status-))

2. Search for "Schedulr"
3. Click "Add to Chrome"

### Manual installation
**Note:** *Using this method will require you to manually clone the project everytime an update is made to this project*
1. Clone git project
2. Go to [chrome extension page](chrome://extensions) and enable developer mode
3. Click on "Load Unpacked" and load the cloned project (Comment out OAuth field in manifest.json to avoid error, take note of item ID)
4. Create a new google cloud project
5. Setup OAuth Consent Screen with "calendar" and "calendar.event" scopes
6. Go to project library and enable Google Calendar API
7. Create an OAuth Client ID (Chrome Extension, Item ID)
8. Replace the "client_id" object with new Client ID in **manifest.json**

## Usage 🕹️
1. Go to your CliC's "My Weekly Schedule" page (***Make sure you're on the very first week of the semester***)
2. Click on the extension, select short (7 weeks) or long (14 weeks) semester.
3. Click submit button.
4. Classes should be added to Google Calendar.

## Key binding ⌨️
- `Alt+Shift+S` - Opens extension page

## Project status ⏳
Currently the extension is available on [Chrome Web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/schedulr/ofaflpillnejkhmkefmcpoamjeaghipp) but my OAuth Consent Screen is in the process of being authenticated.
So the only way to use it right now is to clone the project manually and set up your own extension.

## Tech Stack 🚀
1. Javascript
2. Google API

## Why this project? 🛌
Imagine a world where you can automate your life - cool right? I initially created this to save time on manually transferring my timetable but it seems I've spend more time building it than I would have transferring the timetable manually...oh well.

Since this is my first web project, I'd love to hear any suggetions for improvements you might have!
